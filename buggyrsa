# 1. Implement basic RSA using user input for primes (foundation implementation) 
# 2. set this up with PBT/have PBT generate primes. first assume that all inputs are prime numbers. 
#    (oracle should at this point just be checking that the decrypted message is the same as the plaintext that's been passed in)
# 3. find way for RSA to "check" for primes (using the miller-rabin test maybe)
# 4. Update Oracle to also generate non-prime numbers to input into RSA. we want RSA to reject non-prime numbers in *most* cases
# 5. Then update RSA to include digital signatures
# 6. Alloy model (ask Alexa about what kind of Alloy model this should be)
