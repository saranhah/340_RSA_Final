        This function will eventually implemented to run the some sort of primality test on the two primes provided. It will return False if it is definitive
        that p is a composite number. It will return True if it passes the test, but it is important to note that this does not necessarily
        mean that p is prime (it could be a Carmichael number).

        Input: integer n > 1.
            Check if n is a perfect power: if n = ab for integers a > 1 and b > 1, then output composite.
            Find the smallest r such that ordr(n) > (log2 n)2. If r and n are not coprime, then output composite.
        For all 2 ‚â§ a ‚â§ min (r, n‚àí1), check that a does not divide n: If a|n for some 2 ‚â§ a ‚â§ min (r, n‚àí1), then output composite.
        If n ‚â§ r, then output prime.

# 1. Implement basic RSA using user input for primes (foundation implementation) 
# 2. set this up with PBT/have PBT generate primes. first assume that all inputs are prime numbers.

# 3. find way for RSA to "check" for primes (using the miller-rabin test maybe)
# 4. Update Oracle to also generate non-prime numbers to input into RSA. we want RSA to reject non-prime numbers in *most* cases
# 5. Then update RSA to include digital signatures
# 6. Alloy model (ask Alexa about what kind of Alloy model this should be)
